# PCCDashboard

## Putting your dashboard in the Repo
To ensure that the RaspberryPi can run your dashboard put your dashboard into a new folder and ensure that there is an index.html that runs all of the code within that main folder and not hidden in a sub-folder


## Running the python Script
First run: <br/>
`cd PCCDashboard` <br/>
Then pull the latest code: <br/>
`git pull` <br/>
Run the python script: <br\>
`python3 dynamicDashboard.py` <br\>
Then input the desired delay between the dashboards, minimum 5 second
